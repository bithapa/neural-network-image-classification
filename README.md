# Image Classification using Neural Networks (from scratch)

This project was a part of **AI Scholarship Course** that I won from **Udacity & Facebook**. 
It implements neural network from scratch using Python and PyTorch Library to create deep learning models that can **predict hand-written digits** and **classify MNIST fashion images**.

Technologies Used: Python, PyTorch, NumPy

Pytorch's `torch` documentation: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html

Torchvision datasets: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html

## **How to Run The Code:** 

1. **Open `neural_network.ipynb`** for all the code and results. OR
2. **Clone the repository** with `git clone https://github.com/tito-coffee/aiproject` and open the `nn.ipynb` file in [Jupyter Notebook Editor](https://jupyter.org/install) and run the cells. OR
3. **Run the notebook in Google Colab (Google Sign in required):** [![Open In Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U6SJgKbr-OqX9_fQSYJKV_SeYHExJb4a)

*`helper.py` is a python file that helps to view images and graphs at the same time*
