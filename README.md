# aiproject
This projects implements neural network with PyTorch Library to create deep learning models that can predict hand-written digits and classify MNIST fashion images.

Technologies Used: Python, PyTorch, NumPy

Pytorch's `torch` documentation: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html

Torchvision datasets: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html

## **Instruction:** 

1. **Open `nn.ipynb`** for all the code and results. OR
2. **Clone the repository** with `git clone https://github.com/tito-coffee/aiproject` and open the `nn.ipynb` file in [Jupyter Notebook Editor](https://jupyter.org/install) and run the cells. OR
3. **Run the notebook in Google Colab (Google Sign in required),** [follow this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U6SJgKbr-OqX9_fQSYJKV_SeYHExJb4a)

*`helper.py` is a python file that helps to view images and graphs at the same time*
